# CipherForms: End to End Encrypted Form Builder on the Blockchain powered by vetKeys

## 👋 Introduction

CipherForms is for Web3 companies to "do forms" the Web3 way:

  1. Utilize Web3 wallet login via [Internet Identity](https://identity.ic0.app/).
  2. Create and oversee forms with the ability to:
   - Manage user permissions for forms and submissions.
   - Activate or deactivate form submissions as needed.
  3. Share a public URL for created forms to facilitate submissions.
  4. Safeguard your data on the blockchain instead of relying on major platforms 
     like Google Forms or Typeform.
   
  -> Regarding Form Submissions:
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for heightened security.
   - Grant access only to designated individuals.
   - Ensure submissions remain inaccessible to both the blockchain and smart contract.
   - Employ a straightforward nonce system to counteract spam.
   - Facilitate easy export to CSV for versatile data management.
